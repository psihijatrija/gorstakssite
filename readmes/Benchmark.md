# Gorstak Benchmark v0.4.0

> .NET Framework 4.8 WinForms system benchmark with integrated health analysis. Dark-themed GUI with pie charts, bottleneck detection, system event log scanning, and screenshot export. 351 KB, no runtime install needed.

---

## Overview

Comprehensive system performance testing with CPU, Memory, Disk, GPU, and Network benchmarks plus a system health analysis that scans Windows event logs for hardware errors, GPU crashes, WHEA issues, and reboot patterns.

### Features

- **CPU Benchmark** - Prime calculation (to 50K) + 1M math operations
- **Memory Benchmark** - 10M element array + 100K random access
- **Disk Benchmark** - 100 MB sequential R/W with WriteThrough (bypasses OS cache)
- **GPU Benchmark** - 200x200 matrix multiplication + 100K trig operations
- **Network Benchmark** - Latency (ping) + 10 MB download speed test (1 Gbit = 100%)
- **Bottleneck Detection** - CPU vs GPU imbalance with severity rating
- **System Health Analysis** - Scans event logs for:
  - WHEA hardware errors (memory/PCIe)
  - GPU driver crashes (nvlddmkm/TDR)
  - Reboot frequency (last 24h)
  - ACPI BIOS warnings
  - Bluetooth adapter errors
- **Screenshot Export** - Captures full results + system analysis as JPG/PNG
